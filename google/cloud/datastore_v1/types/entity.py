    empty.

    A partition ID contains several dimensions: project ID and namespace
    ID.

    Partition dimensions:

    -  May be ``""``.
    -  Must be valid UTF-8 bytes.
    -  Must have values that match regex ``[A-Za-z\d\.\-_]{1,100}`` If
       the value of any dimension matches regex ``__.*__``, the
       partition is reserved/read-only. A reserved/read-only partition

    Foreign partition IDs (in which the project ID does not match the
    context project ID ) are discouraged. Reads and writes of foreign
    partition IDs may fail if the project is not in an active state.

            Entities are partitioned into subsets,

        path (Sequence[google.cloud.datastore_v1.types.Key.PathElement]):
            The entity path. An entity path consists of one or more
            elements composed of a kind and a string or numerical
            identifier, which identify entities. The first element
            identifies a *root entity*, the second element identifies a
            *child* of the root entity, the third element identifies a
            child of the second entity, and so forth. The entities
            identified by all prefixes of the path are called the
            element's *ancestors*.

            An entity path is always fully complete: *all* of the

            the entity identifier itself. The only exception is that in
            some documented cases, the identifier in the last path
            element (for the entity) itself may be omitted. For example,
            the last path element of the key of ``Mutation.insert`` may
            have no identifier.
