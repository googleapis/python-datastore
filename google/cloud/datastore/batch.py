    Used to build up a bulk mutation.

    For example, the following snippet of code will put the two ``save``
    operations and the ``delete`` operation into the same mutation, and send
    them to the server in a single API request::

      >>> from google.cloud import datastore

    :meth:`commit` will be called automatically if its block exits without
    raising an exception::

      ...     batch.put(entity1)

      ...     batch.delete(key3)
