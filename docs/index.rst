.. note::

   Because the Datastore client uses the :mod:`grpcio` library by default
   and uses third-party :mod:`requests` library if the GRPC is disabled,
   clients are safe to share instances across threads.  In multiprocessing
   scenarios, the best practice is to create client instances *after*
   :class:`multiprocessing.Pool` or :class:`multiprocessing.Process` invokes
   :func:`os.fork`.
